This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a Python function that leads to unexpected behavior. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` has a logic flaw that causes it to return 0 instead of raising an error when the divisor 'b' is 0.  The solution demonstrates the corrected function that appropriately handles the division-by-zero error, ensuring robust and predictable behavior.
